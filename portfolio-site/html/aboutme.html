							<p></p>
							<p> &nbsp I’m a Puerto Rican currently living in Florida with my hubby and my two fur babies. We enjoy going for long walks with the dogs, going to dog parks and spending time with family.</p>
							<p> &nbsp I'm a lifelong learner, always working to challenge and better myself. I have a great passion for using technology to make learning effective. By applying my skills in both the education and technology fields, my goal is to solve real-world problems for companies and organizations. </p>
							<p> &nbsp This web-portfolio is a representation of what I’ve learned since I decided to change the course of my professional career. I created the projects presented in this web-portfolio; also, I built this website using HTML for the formatting and CSS for styling the webpages. I taught myself web development skills as well as skills in the learning and development domain.</p>
